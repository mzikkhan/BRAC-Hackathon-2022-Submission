This is our ROS Package

This is used for running the algorithms to make the simulated drone move

The simulation used was made by a group of students of SJTU. They were the ones that made the package, sjtu_drone which was used for running the simulation of our project.

The above was the one used by us, it is configured for ROS Noetic and Gazebo 11

Usage:

rosrun drone_urena navigation.py #for running the navigation algorithm

rosrun drone_urena obstacle_avoidance.py #for running the obstacle avoiding algorithm

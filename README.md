# FireFly

We have tried to create a one-stop solution for fire accidents. We have built a mobile app using Android Studio
that can be used in fire emergencies to alert fire services with a tap of a button and it can also be used to call emergency medical services with a simple tap. 
The location coordinates were shared using Google Maps API.

We also simulated a fire-fighting drone using ROS and Gazebo where we simualted how our drone can be automated to fly to the zone of distress using the geolocation coordinates provided by our API. It will be fitted with launchers that can shoot balls filled with fire extinguisher powder - that can
instantly douse the fire by spreading extinguisher powder all around.

I have worked on this project with my teammates Absara Chowdhury, Farhan Ishrak Tahmid and Mahir Al Mahir.
